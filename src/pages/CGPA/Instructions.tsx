          A mathematical formula for calculating GPA or CGPA is to divide the
          Total Quality Points by the Total Attempted Credits. Quality points
          are derived by multiplying credits for the individual course by the
          numeric value of "letter grade" earned in the course, as listed in the
          official grading scale of the University
        </li>

          Grades A+ to F earned in a course are counted towards the calculation
          of SGPA and CGPA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grade F replaced by R or R*, upon repeating a course, will not be
          counted towards the calculation of GPA/SGPA.
        </li>

          In case of a change of major, earned grades of the following courses
          will be transferred to the new major and shall be counted towards the
